	<h1>You hire the Cyclops mercenaries and head for the forest!</h1>

	<img src="../assets/images/cyclops.jpg">

	<p>Your coin goes a long way with these cyclopses! As soon as you enter the forest they go to work on evil slaying... One begins chanting strange words (do cyclopses have a language??), while the others surround the disgusting evil presence... before you can even react they descend apon the evil hacking away at it as the chanting gets louder and louder - until everything goes silent... The chanting one turns to you and says "We killed your evil for you - let us know next time you need help... unless you don't have coin, then don't bother" The band of mercenaries gather their things and leave the forest, walking off into the sunset - in true hero style!</p>

	<h2>The evil is destroyed... all it took was your entire life savings!</h2>
