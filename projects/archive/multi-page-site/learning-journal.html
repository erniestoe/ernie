		<h1>Learning Journal</h1>

		<p>So far things with DFTW are going pretty good for me! I've written about this already
		 but I feel like I really am slowing down and finally taking the "right" steps to learning this stuff. Trying to learn all this on my own I had built some bad habits and weak foundations. I feel like from the outside viewing in it might seem strange spending weeks not even coding but preparing myself to code and design, but I think the first few modules have honestly taught me alot that will help me later on when I really start coding!</p>
