   <h1>This is a single document title! (heading level 1)</h1>
   <p>The purpose of this document is to see how I do for the word processor challenge for DFTW.
    I use google docs pretty regularly for work so I gave myself 30 minutes to see if I actually know what 
 I am doing haha. </p>

 <h2>My favorite place - Krankies</h2>
 <p>I’m not much of a go out to eat person but this place is the main place 
   I take people to go when they visit me lol. They have a small menu but I think their biscuits are pretty good - my favorite being their Krankies Klasic (fried chicken with hot honey in a biscuit). 
   They also have pretty good coffee and tea - I got a sugar plum chai latte the other day that was quite festive.
   They are located right in the center of downtown Winston Salem in what's called Innovation Quarter so it's easy to get something there and then just walk around afterwards.

<h2 >Types of food</h2>
<p>I’m choosing Pastel de choclo, Sushi and Pizza - because these are my favorite types. 
   I tried to be kind of specific so that I could better pinpoint the ingredients. 
   Pastel de Choclo is a traditional chilean food that's basically shepherds pie but with sweet corn instead -
   pureed corn on top, meat on bottom. Sushi is just something that scares me a little (raw fish!) but it also tastes so
   good. Finally pizza is just that food that I feel like is so easy to find but can be done in so many different ways - 
it's also typically just feel good food for me. </p>

<h3>PASTEL DE CHOCLO</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Corn</li>
   <li>Ground beef</li>
   <li>Raisins</li>
</ol>

<h3>SUSHI</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Seaweed</li>
   <li>Sushi rice</li>
   <li>Raw Tuna</li>
</ol>

<h3 >PIZZA</h3>
<ol>
   <li>Flour (dough)</li>
   <li>Tomato sauce</li>
   <li>Cheese</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reading over this I realize that everything I have written seems to 
   be about food! I promise the Krankies is really more a location / vibe thing than just the food.
   I also spent too much time thinking about the types of food and went over my 30 minute timer haha.
