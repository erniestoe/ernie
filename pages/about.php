				<p>I’ve always had big ideas and something to say, and over some long tireless years, I’ve learned how to turn those ideas into work that moves people.</p>

				<p>To me, design is translation.</p>

				<p>Taking scattered thoughts, half baked messages, and good intentions; and shape them into something that lands.</p>

				<p>A scroll stopping Reel.</p>

				<p>A campaign that sparks curiosity and speaks to the right people.</p>

				<p>A system built to earn trust.</p>

				<p>I design for clarity and impact. That's it.</p>

				<p>Not for clicks or trends, and not just to "look pretty".</p>

				<p>Aesthetics recycle and algorithms rewrite themselves but, strong communication, one that's both intentional and human, always cuts through the noise.</p>

				<p>I work everyday to find that signal.</p>

				<p>The one that builds stories, visuals, and systems that connect ideas to action; To remind people that <em>meaning</em> still matters.</p>

				<p>That doesn't mean I’m endlessly faffing about, on the contrary, I move fast and thrive in chaos. Just ask the food pantry I helped run during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

				<p>I’m not a stress junkie by any means, but when the work matters, the pressure’s worth it.</p>

				<p>Simple as that.</p>

				<p>I design to find the way though the fire and into our next golden age, regardless of how short lived it might be.</p>
