					<p>This categorization was meant to be both descriptive and loosely predictive: BiPS intent was 10 develop a metric for starting policy analysis of the oity' neighborhoods that would motivate fotow-up in neighborhoods in need. The acompanying report catts for "data drildowns" in neighborhoods identified by the typology as at risk of perertication. While the map alows policymakers to more easily visualice those aroos requiring intervention, goverments need to gather more detaled data on a neighberhood demographic profit, housing vulnerabilty, and commercial activity and ownership in order to more effectively plan the nent steps. In 2015, Portiond did Just this with ta NINE Neighborhood Housing Plan. Alter using the city's map-of neighborhood change to identity North and Northeast Portland as areas experiencing significant gentification and displacement pressure. the Portand Housing Buroou (PHD organized community forums and outreach efforts in an effort to better understand the types of housing assistance that would be most heiphut</p>

					<p>Providing the most fine-grained analysis of displacement risk, the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development (ANHO) created the Displacement Alert Project Map lor Dap. Mapl. which assesses displacement risk bullding-by-bulding in New York City. The analysis unes publicly-evadable data on 96,000 Now York buidings and assigns eoch a risk score based on three factors: loss of ront-regulatod units, rate of tenant turnover, and price the bulding scid for After standardizing each factor on a scale of 10Q, ANHD added the three and as signod each bulding a combinod riek score from O to 300, then displeyed each score on on Indoractive map. Using these factors, ANHD hopes to tarpet the direct causes of deplacement higher prices based on speculative behavior and an influx of new residents. Armed with this cos y-accessible information, residents, community groups, and the local government have the capacity to target displacement on a buiding-by-building level, expose abusve landlords, and fight back against the loss.</p>

					<h3 class="attention-voice">Portiand was one of the first U.S. cities to use data visualizations in order to better understand neighborhood change and displacement. For the first of three mapping layers, the city's Bureau of Planning and Sustainability (BPS) used mostly publicly-available Census and ACS data on housing tenure and price changes, income level, educational attainment, and racial/ethnic population changes in order to assess gentrification risk in each Census tract.</h3>
