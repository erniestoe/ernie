			Hey. Thanks for scrolling down! I'm Ernie (Ernesto Rivera-Saavedra) and for the past 7 years Iâ€™ve been working in nonprofits, juggling website updates, flyers, and data analysis. Then one day I realized my real passion was in designing impactful and clear experiences. So, I'm using the strategy I've learned from nonprofits, storytelling from data, and the technical foundations from my computer science degree, to shape myself into your next best choice.

If I'm not adding yet another sans-serif typface to my stash, I'm probably hiking with my wife and our <span class="underlined">Puerto Rican rescue dog Doc</span>, <a target='_blank' href='https://www.instagram.com/erniestoe/'>taking photos</a>, or <a target='_blank' href='https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0N8Lx0njx25Udmeg351kSA?si=4a00dfc055774625'>making playlists.</a></p>
