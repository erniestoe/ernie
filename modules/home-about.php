			Hello! I’m Ernie (Ernesto Rivera-Saavedra), a graphic designer who has supported nonprofit organizations with project and program management for the past 7 years. Translation: I know firsthand how clarity and storytelling can drive real impact. Today, I use that experience to help organizations drive impact through communications.
