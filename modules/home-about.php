	<h3 class="loud-voice">A litte more about me.</h3>

	<p>
		For the past 7 years I’ve been working in nonprofits, juggling website updates, flyers, and data analysis, before realizing my real passion was in designing impactful and clear experiences. Along the way, I’ve picked up strategy from nonprofits, storytelling from data, and technical foundations from computer science, which shape who I am as a designer today.
