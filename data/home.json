{
	"about": "Winston-Salem, NC based interdisciplinary designer with a focus on clarity, craft and <em>good design</em>. I want to build things that earn attention not by being trendy, but by being well thought out, rooted in fundamentals, and carefully executed. My approach is deliberate, and aims to show that I care about how something <em>works</em> as much as how it <em>looks</em>. Long term goal? Work alongside teams who take design seriously like Pentagram, PORTO ROCHA, or Cotton.",
