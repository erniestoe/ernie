		"projectName": "OpenResource Theme",
		"projectGoal": "The main goal of this project was to see if I could make a digital directory of community resources thats accessible for everyone and easily replicated to have information from all communities. ",
		"projectOverview": "I landed on an initial version called OpenResource – a custom WordPress theme I created to streamline the experience of discovering and sharing local community resources. The idea was to take clunky, hard-to-update resource lists and bring them online in a way that’s easy to browse, maintain, and share… For now, that led me to a simple WordPress theme that’s still being refined and improved as I learn more about things like accessibility and usability. While the WordPress version makes the project accessible to users already familiar with the platform, long-term I’d like to make it even more approachable / platform independent.",
		"projectProblem": "In past roles at nonprofits, I often saw that it was hard to find reliable, up-to-date lists of community of resources. Most of the time, they were literal physical binders of papers or outdated PDFs... so... not great.",
		"projectResearch": "This project was a bit light on the acutal research. Reason being, at its core, It’s essentially a CRUD app with a PDF cart so... a very simple concept. The bulk of my research focused on how I wanted the experience to feel both in terms of the visuals and the user flow. I tried to avoid leaning on terms like “minimal” or “simple,” and instead moved towards more human terms like “accessible,” “welcoming,” and “professional” when making my style tiles. I eventually landed on the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oliviaking.com/inclusivesans/feature'>Inclusive Sans</a> typeface and a palette generated with <a target='_blank' href='https://randoma11y.com/'>randoma11y</a> for accessible color contrast.",
		"projectSolution": "Right now my solution is OpenResource - a lightweight, mobile-friendly WordPress theme utilizing PHP templates and ACF (Advanced Custom Fields). Some current features are:",
		"projectFeatures": [
			{
				"feature": "A dynamic filtering system using JavaScript for asynchronous loading"
			},
			{
				"feature": "A session-based PDF “cart” that lets users collect and download custom summaries"
			},
			{
				"feature": "A CMS-friendly admin interface with custom post types and field groups"
			}
		],
		"projectApproach": "I started out making a <a target='_blank' href='https://peprojects.dev/beta-two/ernie/projects/resource-list/index.php'>PHP only prototype</a> and converted that into a WordPress theme to make it more accessible for non-technical users. I used semantic HTML, modular CSS, and progressive enhancement to build a working alpha up and running without getting stuck on it being perfect. I chose this approach to help me showcase the project publicly, start receiving feedback, and leave room for others to customize or contribute.",
		"projectResults": "So right now OpenResource is live, functional, and available for others to use via GitHub. It’s still a work in progress, but that’s on purpose! I wanted to avoid perfection paralysis and get the project out in the open. This process helped me solidify my knowledge of PHP and WordPress development while also teaching me to balance ambition with momentum. It’s already being used to power <a target='_blank' href='https://forsythcommunityresources.com/'>forsythcommunityresources.com</a>, and I’m actively iterating as I learn and grow.",
		"projectChallenges": [

				"text": "Balancing simplicity with real-world usefulness (deciding when to go native vs when to lean on plugins)."

		"projectName": "OpenResource Site",
		"projectGoal": "Create a landing and eventual docs site for the OpenResouce theme.",
		"projectOverview": "The OpenResource Landing Site is a companion marketing and (eventually) documentation site for the OpenResource WordPress theme. Its primary goal is to introduce the project, explain its purpose, offer a clear starting point for users, and share ongoing updates. The site is designed using the same visual language as <a target='_blank' href='https://forsythcommunityresources.com/'>forsythcommunityresources.com</a> to maintain consistency between the demo and the theme.",
		"projectProblem": "While building the OpenResource theme, I realized that simply having the theme on GitHub with a README made the project feel a little disconnected (lonely?). I wanted things to feel more intentional and cohesive. Having a standalone landing site allows me to create a stronger visual and conceptual connection between the theme and its intended use. I also don't like the idea of just leaving my documentation just on the Github page.",
		"projectResearch": "There wasn’t a ton of research for this project — instead, I reused and lightly restyled the existing style tile from the OpenResource theme to maintain visual consistency. The layout itself was based on a previous <a target='_blank' href='../projects/soccer-theme/index.php'>Soccer Theme project</a> where I practiced conditional rendering with PHP.",
		"projectSolution": "The site uses a pretty common layout with subtle visual differences from the theme - like sharper edges instead of roundy ones and a different main color (green). I did this mainly to subtly show how easily the theme can be customized. Features:",
		"projectFeatures": [
			{
				"feature": "A clean hero section explaining the project’s purpose"
			},
			{
				"feature": "Modular CTA cards linking to GitHub, live demos, and contact"
			},
			{
				"feature": "A quick-start guide (currently offloaded to the GitHub README)"
			}
		],
		"projectApproach": "I created the landing site as a separate WordPress install using ACF Pro to manage content. I kept the design simple and responsive, prioritizing speed and clarity. Rather than building full documentation at this stage, I linked directly to GitHub to reduce overhead while keeping critical information available.",
		"projectResults": "The site now provides a gentle onboarding experience for the OpenResource theme. It adds context, communicates the intent of the project, and demonstrates how the theme can be customized with just a few small changes. It also doubles as another example of thoughtful design-focused WordPress development that I can do.",
		"projectChallenges": [
			{
				"text": "Keeping the site visually distinct from the theme, but still clearly related."
			},
			{
				"text": "Deciding how much content should live directly in WordPress versus being linked out."
			},
			{
				"text": "Avoiding overbuilding while still making it feel polished and complete."
