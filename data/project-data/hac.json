		{"content": "<p>I’ve seen firsthand how nonprofits can struggle with looking credible to donors while staying relevant to younger volunteers and communities. Hunger Action Coalition was a conceptual project I took on to test how a single identity could flex between audiences without losing consistency.</p><p>My solution was to design a system with two voices: a muted, professional core identity to build donor trust, and a more bold, youth focused layer for outreach and volunteer engagement. The system uses typography, color and layout shifts to communicate to different audiences without creating a confused brand.</p>"}

	"reflection": "<p>This project taught me the importance of designing with dual audiences in mind. What worked well was building flexibility directly into the system, rather than treating youth outreach as an afterthought.</p><p>If I were to continue, I’d develop templates to make adoption even easier for nonprofits.</p>",
