So I dug deep into my past experiences to build a initial core pallette and a logo suite that met the organizations goals. Followed by a (probably way too early) sketch of a potential landing page.</p></case-text-block>",

My goal was to use this idea of “two voices” to create a collection of instagram templates that could be repurposed indefinitely. </p></case-text-block>",

The key takeaway here is that a nonprofit doesn't have to be so one note when it comes to branding.</p></case-text-block>",
