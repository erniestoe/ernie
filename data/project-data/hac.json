This inconsistency undermines credibility with donors and causes unnecessary confusion for organization members. In this project, I set out to design a simple, unified brand system for a conceptual nonprofit. The challenge being making a brand clear enough for everyday use while staying flexible enough to grow with the organization.</p></case-text-block>",

I designed a set of templates for Instagram that lock in brand colors, fonts and logo usage. The goal being to ensure every post reinforces the brand identity regardless of who on staff is creating content.</p></case-text-block>",

Through a clear identity and practical templates, staff can spend less time “winging it” and more time focusing on the mission and delivering impactful work. The result here is clarity, confidence, and a stronger donor and community presence.</p></case-text-block>",
