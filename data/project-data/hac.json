Branding a conceptual music venue was fun and all, but it got me thinking… How would this idea of one brand with multiple faces look like in a real (not so real) nonprofit organization? Could they brand themselves in a way that both tackles a serious topic while being able speak to a younger audience that can often feel “unseen” by these groups? That’s the challenge I took on with Hunger Action Coalition (probably should have been “THE” Hunger Action Coalition...)</p>"}

Followed by some (probably way too early) sketches of a landing page.</p></case-text-block>",

The first three are a bit more serious and tame, while the following three introduce bold colors and imagery while still maintaining core brand elements, creating ultimate cohesion.</p></case-text-block>",
