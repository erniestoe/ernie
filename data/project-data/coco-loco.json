For this project I wanted a palette that spoke to the colorful heritage of Puerto Rico while not being over reliant on it. In this case color is meant to enhance and uplift not overpower.</p></case-text-block>",

So, just to be on the safe side I paired the bold badge with slightly more toned down wordmarks to keep the badge from becoming overused. To me the badge spoke to the American aspect of being Puerto Rican, however different the cultures may be they somehow find a way to be deeply intertwined and this is no different.</p></case-text-block>",

A simple two column layout paired with a small accent piece of the Coco Loco himself is where I went to balance readability and clarity, with brand awareness.</p></case-text-block>",

I kept the rules pretty simple: Pictures should take up the full post, if text is overlaid it should not be without a background, characters and graphics should be relevant to the message in some way. Making little systems like these are one of those things that I can say I truly enjoy.</p></case-text-block>",
