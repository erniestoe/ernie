CRFT was a conceptual project I took on to explore that challenge in the context of a music venue.</p><p>My solution was to design a system built on minimal, geometric form paired with bold, duotone treatments. The core identity is clean and restrained, while event posters and digital assets push into louder, more expressive territory to give the brand both credibility and vibrancy.</p>"}

What worked well was establishing clear rules for type and color early, allowing me to keep brand consistency across posters, screens, and social media posts.</p><p>If I were to continue, I'd build out a more extensive toolkit for venues to use independently</p>",
