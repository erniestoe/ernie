			"caption": "Showcasing the main colors of the brand (black and white) in a real world setting. These designs also have a wordmark logo attached to each bottom left corner. <br><br>This Design in particular was meant to invoke curiosty into the brand (hence the logo being the main subject) without promiting a singular event. The pattern of alternating between black and white is a call to the rythmic electronic music you can expect to hear at this venue."

			"caption": "This second piece of promotional design was created to be used as a template to showcase their monthly lineup. It uses one of the secondary colors from their palette that manages to be welcoming but alos eye catching.<br><br> Once again the goal here was to be minimal and modular. Both the logo and the CRFT OCTOBER text suggest a sort of 'building' around the event lineup, suggesting to the viewer that all of these events will take place within CRFT."

			"caption": "Here I designed promo material (also a template) for artist spolights. I felt that they could use some material for more of their big name acts. <br><br>Suprise, suprise the design here was very minimal and modular. Almost too minimal? I intentionally left out information like the time and adress to really draw attention to the artist and the wordmarked logo in the bottom left corner.<br><br> This sort of promo material should be used <em>after</em> the grand opening and some social media marketing has taken place."

			"caption": "I made the call that any image of an artist or non illustrations in general should be given a duotone treatment with one of the accent palette colors. <br><br>This was to both give an opportunity to use those colors and to add contrast to the black and white main palette. It also really drives home that feeling of being new and fresh on the scene."
