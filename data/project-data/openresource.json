	"caseStudy": "OpenResource is a community-focused project designed to help people share and access local resources with clarity and ease. Built on values of community, accessibility, and openness, OpenResource provides both a flexible visual identity and a practical digital tool. I designed a unified brand system — including a refreshed logo, typography, color palette, and communication materials — and created a clear, approachable landing site to explain its purpose. I also designed and developed a custom WordPress theme as OpenResource’s core tool, allowing any community to build and maintain its own resource directory. This theme supports browsing, filtering, and downloading of resources in accessible, printable formats. A key part of this project was separating OpenResource’s visual system from the WordPress theme itself — allowing the brand to stand on its own while showcasing the theme’s flexibility through real-world use, like Forsyth Community Resources.",
