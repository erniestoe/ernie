So in an unusual fashion I worked backwards and created a brand to center around the template. Essentially turning OpenResource the theme into OpenResource the project behind the theme.",

Essentially this was my proof of concept for OpenResource, that A. I could actually make it and B. It wouldn’t be terrible.<br><br>After my prototype I was excited to move to phase two which was releasing it as an open sourced project that anyone could grab and make their own!<br><br>One problem though… Technical debt.<br><br>While yes in theory if I put out that code (it technically is out now if you want it) it would mean that in order for you as the <em>user</em> you would need: A text editor to make changes, some kind of local PHP server to view those changes, and then find a hosting service that supports PHP sites (then either manually move files over or learn how to use git and pipelines). So yeah, not very user friendly.<br><br>That's where WordPress enters the picture. As someone who has been around nonprofits for a while both professionally and personally, I knew that they often defaulted to using WordPress for their websites (sometimes Wix and Squarespace, but we shan't speak those names here)."

			"caption": "So my initial conversion from full PHP prototype to WordPress template turned into this. I kept the name Forsyth Community Resources because at the time that is what made the most sense to me (this was the <em>brand</em>).<br><br>This turned out to be one of those projects that given the opportunity could be stuck in development for 3 years while I make it perfect. The goal here was not perfection, just usability. As long as users could find resources, and add them to their PDF which can then be printed or saved, then the project could be released in an alpha state.<br><br>Once I did release the theme though a big thing stuck out to me. How do I distinguish the OpenResource theme from Forsyth Community Resources? At that moment they were the same thing."
