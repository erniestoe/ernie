So far, I’ve focused on making flows and systems that make clear and trustworthy directories which already feels like an improvement to the status quo. While in its current state it works as a single site, OpenResource is still in progress, with the goal to expand this out into a full design system that organizations can adapt to their own local directories.</p></case-text-block>",
