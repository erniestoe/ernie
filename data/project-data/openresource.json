		{"content": "<p>I’ve seen how nonprofits and community groups often have to “make do” with inconsistent, improvised directories. The result is confusing layouts, accessibility issues, and a lot of duplicated effort. So, I created OpenResource to see how to solve that problem. So far I have a system that instead of presribing a single look, it establishes core principles that adapt to different organizations, audiences, and styles.</p><p>This case tests the system's flexibility by pushing it to an intentionally bold, highly stylistic example. </p>"}

	"reflection": "<p>While I'm by no means finished, this project has already taught me the potential of designing a system around principles, rather than fixed aesthetics. This means with one system you can build both simple, neutral directories and highly expressive ones.</p><p>As I continue, I will expand the system into layouts and base components to make adoption easier for real nonprofits.</p>",
