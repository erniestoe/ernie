	"caseStudy": "ticketapp is a JavaScript-based prototype simulating a mobile ticket booking experience. I structured the app inside a faux-phone container, using plain JavaScript and a single render root — inspired by, but not dependent on, frameworks like React. While I built out full flows for browsing shows, selecting seats, and viewing tickets, the biggest takeaway wasn’t the app itself — it was clarity. I realized I’m more drawn to designing expressive brands and websites for things like theaters, not necessarily the apps inside them. Still, this project was a solid testbed for DOM logic, localStorage, and learning how to simplify when code gets overcomplicated.",
