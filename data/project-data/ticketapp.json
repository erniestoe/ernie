	"caseStudy": "ticketapp is a JavaScript only prototype simulating a mobile ticket booking experience. I styled the app to be inside a fake phone container, and used vanilla JavaScript with a single render root. I was inspired by frameworks like react but was motivated to purposefully not use them to get a better understanding on how they work under the hood. While I did build out full flows for browsing shows, selecting seats, and viewing tickets, the biggest thing I learned from this was clarity. After going through this I realized Iâ€™m more drawn to designing expressive brands and websites for things like theatres, not necessarily the apps within them. That said, this project was a solid learning experience for DOM logic, localStorage, and when to simplify when code gets too complicated.",
