	"caseStudy": "Found this brief from the book Hello Design World (good read, would recommend!). So the distilled version of it was: Disney(the client) wants to see one homepage (the deliverable) to promote the newest Pirates of the Caribbean movie to 10-34 year olds (target audience) and want to make it seem like the new movie is new and different (visual goal). So right off the bat I decided to time box this brief to one day, to add a little challenge. After conducting some research I quickly decided on a visual direction to take things: I decided that if Pirates of the Caribbean was a person then it would probably be Jack Sparrow so I focused it around that. Red for his bandana, the infamous skull and bones of Jack Sparrow (unofficial logo?) for imagery, a Serif font to suggest brand heritage paired with a more modern Sans Serif to make things feel new and fresh. In terms of feeling I really leaned into movie posters and in particular the posters / marketing from Alien Romulus as I felt they were trying to do the same thing: Introduce a new Alien movie to the franchise, that was both fresh and not like the others while also staying true to the franchise. So the main deliverable was a live mockup site followed by designs, and a poster to be used in potential campaigns.",
